# Instruction for running on Raspberry print

1. Install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

2. To test the object detection model on single image, run test_detect.py: python test_detect.py
    Adjust the following variables:

        * model_path: path to the tflite model to use.
        * input_size: Input size of selected tflite model:
            efficient_Det_0.tflite -> (320, 320)
            efficient_Det_1.tflite -> (384, 384)
            efficient_Det_4.tflite -> (640, 640)
        * test_image_path: path to the test image file
        * test_image_bbox_path: path for the resulting detection image (with bounding box)
        * score_threshold: detection confidence threshold

3. To test the object detection model on single image, run rpi_detection.py: python rpi_detection.py
    Adjust the following variables:

        * is_flip: Set this to True or False depending on your camera orientation. Try this by experiment.
        * model_path: path to the tflite model to use.
        * input_size: Input size of selected tflite model:
            efficient_Det_0.tflite -> (320, 320)
            efficient_Det_1.tflite -> (384, 384)
            efficient_Det_4.tflite -> (640, 640)
        * test_image_path: path to the test image file
        * test_image_bbox_path: path for the resulting detection image (with bounding box)
        * score_threshold: detection confidence threshold
